# Bootstrap-Rails-Three

Simple way to include version 3.0.0 of [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap) in your Rails app. Please note that version 3.0.0 is a work in progress and subject to bugs and/or breaking changes.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```rails
    gem 'bootstrap-rails-three', :github => 'asanderson15/bootstrap-rails-three', :branch => 'master'
```

And then execute:

```bash
    $ bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
    $ gem install bootstrap-rails-three
```

## Usage

To implement this in Rails, add the following code to your *application.css* and *application.js* files:

**app/assets/javascripts/application.js**

```javascript
//= require twitter/bootstrap
```

**app/assets/stylesheets/application.css**

```css
/*
*= require twitter/bootstrap
*/
```

## Thanks

Thanks to [Twitter](http://twitter.com) for [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap). It is awesome!

Thanks to AnjLab for [bootstrap-rails](http://github.com/anjlab/bootstrap-rails/) and Seyhun Aky√ºrek for [twitter-bootstrap-rails](https://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails) gems. They were the inspiration. If you have a production app, you may want to use their gems as they are likely better maintained and more stable. 


## Issues?

This is my first gem, so I would not be surprised if I messed something up. If so, please feel free to fork this or submit an issue or pull request. Thanks for your patience!
